# Jpoint 2025 Spring Aio Stand Demo

## Glossary:

1. SDJ - Spring Data JDBC

## 1. Criteria API Usage in Spring JDBC.

FAG:

Q: Any way of executing Criteria without JdbcAggregateTemplate? <br/>
A: **Currently, no, unfortunately**. BUT! There is a discussion about that, stay
tuned in Spring Aio Chat!

Q: Any analog of JPA Criteria API `distinct()`/`join()`/`groupBy`? <br/>
A: **No, not yet**. As a consequence, there is no way to express `JOIN` SQL construct 
via Criteria API. If you need this one, please, let Mikhail Polivakha know.
He had a discussion about it internally, but there seems to be no urgent need in this

Q: In Hibernate, we have a type-safe `StaticMetamodel` API generated by APT. Anything
similar in SDJ? <br/>
A: No, not yet. It is not inherently hard to implement it, it is just that it requires
a lot of engineering time and nobody really did it before. But if you need it, again,
reach out to Mikhail, he will look into it.
